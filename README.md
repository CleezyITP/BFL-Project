### Development Flow
1. Create feature branches for small features. For example, `feature-user-interface` would be bad. `feature-chatbox-style` would be good. Branches should be prefixed with `feature-` or `fix-`.
2. Create a pull request from your branch when you're ready (and tested!!).
3. Once all group members have commented on the pull request saying it looks amazingtastic, please merge your own pull request.
4. Remove your branch.
